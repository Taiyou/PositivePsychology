# Why are you applying for Financial Aid? 
I am currently a Ph.D candidate in systems neuroscience.
After my graduation, I would like to start combining machine learning technique and brain science to promote people's mental health.
To do so, I try to study positive neuroscience and positive psychology.
However, in my country, Japan, income for students is least for living life.
I consume my income for tuition fee, housing costs and food expense. 
Hence, it is hard to keep enough money for budget for taking online courses under this condition, but I need to save money as much as I can. On the other hand, I also try to change my major from systems neuroscience to positive neuroscience. Although I study positive neuroscience, due to my specialty transfer I do not have enough practical knowledge of positive psychology. I would like to learn basics of positive psychology. Given this circumstance, I need to learn positive psychology fficiently with minimum money.
Therefore, I would like to ask financial aid.

# How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?
My career goal is to start business combining positive psychology, brain science and machine learning to promote humanâ€™s mental health. To do so, I have two career-wise reasons to take this course, positive psychology.


First, understanding positive psychology is what I must learn. Under my Ph.D, I have been developing knowledge and understanding of mental health based on brain science and machine learning. However, I realized that I have not explored how human mental health works and how we can promote it. The understanding would also deepen my knowledge of positive neuroscience. To understand them, I need to take courses from a positive psychology course. 


Second, learning basics of positive psychology is the key for job hunting too. I am thinking to work in a research venture company to learn how to start my business. Understanding of practical usage of positive psychology would be useful to appeal to other people.

Those are the two reasons why taking this course is critical for my career.
