# Week 2
## 2.1 Collecting Data
### type of error
- random error
- systematic error
### Validity
- costruct validity
- content validity
- predictive validity
## Reliability
- consistentcy
The reliability of a measure can be captured in a number of ways:

1. Test-retest reliability
- Variation in measurements taken by a single person or instrument on the same item, under the same conditions, and in a short period of time (e.g., how consistent my scores on the grit scale would be today with my scores next week).
2. Internal consistency reliability
- Assesses the consistency of results across items within a test (e.g., assessing how consistently someone answers self-control questions across the scale)
3. Inter-rater reliability
- The degree of agreement among raters (e.g., evaluating how consistently two raters score a child on the self-control scale)

## 2.2 Quantitative methods
### Surveys
- strengths
1. massively collect samples
- disadvantage
1. low response rates
2. response rate < 50%

### Self-report bias
- disadvantage
1. reference group changes

### Halo effect
- talent and beuty
### social desiability bias
### Drafting survey questions
- use questions that easy to understand
- provide definitions where necessary
- provide a framework of context
- start with straightforward questions and move toward sensitive ones.
### Administrative data
- ratings
- bio data
- assessments
- strength
1. may already exist
2. less likely to be biased
3. does not burden participants.
- does it really capture the right construct.
